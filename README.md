## Key Features

**The most challenging features implemented

- Budgeting: Updating chart data in real time. The data passed to the chart components needed to be in the computed function instead of watch so it would update properly.
- Search: Category/tag sorting - for Purchased List, there can only be one category assigned to an item, while Wish List can have multiple ("tags" instead of a "category").

Device integration(s)?

- Camera integration: When on mobile, the user can take a photo of the item to add to their Wish List/Purchased List.
